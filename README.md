# Feed Reader

A simple RSS and Atom feed reader built with .NET and WPF.

This is a personal project for me to exercise my .NET and C# knowledge, and to learn WPF. I don't recommend anyone try to use it at present, as it's currently unfinished. Even when finished it will be pretty bare bones. Depending on how it turns out I may or may not use it as my main feed reader (I'm currently using [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) and am quite happy with it).

The app is structured using the MVVM architecture.

I've recently begun adding unit tests. So far I've added tests for the data access layer of the app.
