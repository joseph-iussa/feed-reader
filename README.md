# Feed Reader

A simple RSS and Atom feed reader built with .NET and WPF.

This is a personal project for me to exercise my .NET and C# knowledge, and to learn WPF. I don't recommend anyone try to use it at present, as it's currently unfinished. Even when finished it will be pretty bare bones. Depending on how it turns out I may or may not use it as my main feed reader (I'm currently using [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) and am quite happy with it).

The app is structured using the MVVM architecture.

I'm currently in the process of adding tests, both integration and unit. I've written integration tests for direct database interactions and am in the process of writing unit tests for the rest of the application.
