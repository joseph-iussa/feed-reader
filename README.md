# Feed Reader

A simple RSS and Atom feed reader built with .NET and WPF.

This is a personal project for me to exercise my .NET and C# knowledge, and to learn WPF. I don't recommend anyone try to use it at present, as it's currently unfinished. Even when finished it will be pretty bare bones. Depending on how it turns out I may or may not use it as my main feed reader (I'm currently using [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) and am quite happy with it).

At present there are no tests. This is mainly because the mental overhead of writing the app at the same time as learning WPF has been quite large. The present architecture of the app is also not very amenable to testing. In the future I plan to restructure the app to use the MVVM architercture, which will make the app far more testable.
